# Spot-the-Mask
This is my learning notebook as i begin my journey in CV. 

Face masks have become a common public sight in the last few months. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recently advised the use of simple cloth face coverings to slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others. Wearing masks is broadly recognised as critical to reducing community transmission and limiting touching of the face.
In a time of concern about slowing the transmission of COVID-19, increased surveillance combined with AI solutions can improve monitoring and reduce the human effort needed to limit the spread of this disease. The objective of this challenge is to create an image classification machine learning model to accurately predict the likelihood that an image contains a person wearing a face mask, or not.
